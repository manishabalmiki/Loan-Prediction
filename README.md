# Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a loan should be approved or not based on applicant details using supervised machine learning models. The dataset used is from the Loan Prediction practice problem on platforms like Analytics Vidhya or Kaggle.

## 📊 Project Overview

Loan prediction is a classic classification problem where we predict a binary outcome (Loan Approved: Yes/No). This can help financial institutions make faster and more accurate decisions.

### 🔧 Features

- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Multiple ML Model Building
- Model Evaluation and Comparison
- Result Visualization

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- (Optional) Support Vector Machine

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Gender`, `Married`, `Dependents`, `Education`, `Self_Employed`
- `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, `Credit_History`
- `Property_Area`, `Loan_Status`
